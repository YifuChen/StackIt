## Game Rules

The goal is to stack up blocks as high as possible. Be careful! If the new brick is not landing perfectly on the top of stack, the excessive portion out of top brick's border will disappear! If you totally miss the top brick, game ends.


## Interactions

Blocks will come from two directions, namely along X axis and Z axis, and they will be stacked up along Y axis.

The player will only need to hit "**SPACE**" to decide the right time or position to drop a new block on the stack.


## To-do

- [ ] UI: tutorial, leaderboard, back button, social media sharing buttons, more animations
- [ ] Backend: hook up with firebase to enable basic user login, game history and leaderboard
